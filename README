Collection of script to manage an encrypted loop back image.

To use these scripts, first clone the repo:

    $ cd $HOME
    $ git clone git@bitbucket.org:taroth/secure-data-mgmt.git Secure
    $ cd Secure

Then, create an encrypted loop back image:

    $ ./sec-create.sh

Once the loop back image is created, mount the image:

    $ ./sec-mount.sh

Use the encrypted image that is mounted at '/sec-data'.

When you are done with the image, unmount it:

    $ ./sec-umount.sh

Note: All the sec-*.sh scripts must be run from the Secure git repo (created
by the git clone command above).
